Dense layer - layer that is deeply connected with its preceding layer which
    means the neurons of the layer are connected to every neuron of its
    preceding layer.
LSTM layer - are a special kind of RNNs that deals with the long term
    dependency problem effectively. LSTM networks have a repeating module that
    has 4 different neural network layers interacting to deal with the long
    term dependency problem.
